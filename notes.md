## What is AI, Data Science and Machine Learning?

- AI: Human intelligence replicated by a computer. This is currently limited to narrow-AI, which means it is single purpose with no real adaptability to do other things, which is termed general AI.
- Data Science: Data analysis that looks at ways to make use of data.
- Machine Learning: An ability to find patterns in a collection of data and make predictions / recommendations based on that data. It uses an algorithm (called a model) to do analysis against a data set and look for patterns and make predictions based on that models analysis.
- Deep Learning: An algorithm used in machine learning.

- Supervised Learning: Using data that has structure / labels, such as a spreadsheet, CSV file or database.
- Unsupervised Learning: Using data that has no defined structure / labels, such as a CSV file with no column names. ML will be used to create categories for the data and group up alike data points (clustering). It can also use multiple data points that can be used together to create associations that can be used by ML to make recommendations based on a number of data points.
- Reinforcement: Teaching a model to learn by repeating something, such as playing a game until it gets good at it. Also called skill acquisition and real-time learning.
